      <li><a href="posts/first-post.html">‚ü∂ Happy Tuesday beautiful people. I know what you are thinking -- no more podcast????? But no worries, i am only switching to a blog. Creating a podcast requires more time than I would like to admit and with adult life coming in at full force, I still wanted to get some content out to you guys in a way that is time effective not only for me but for our audience. Instead of listening to an hour long podcast, you can now read what we want to share in minutess. We are so happy for this journey and cannot wait to share it with you guys with God at the center. This website contains a section so our new audience can get to know me, what gospel song has been on my mind lately, a message wall to share your thoughts, my daily blogs, and of course I am still keeping the verse of the day. Dont forget to click socials to follow the blog page for updates and more. Are you ready? (July 2025)</a></li>
