    <h2>The Blood That Gives Life, The Blood That Needs Help</h2>
    <p><em>Posted September 2025</em></p>

    <article>
      <p>Redeemed by His sacrifice, strengthened by His grace, and still challenged by my own sickle blood. As you all know I have sickle cell, so I would love to spread awarenes of my own. There is so many misconceptions on what sickle cell is and how detrimental it really is to one's life. With sickle cell, I was unable to play sports growing up due to the constant pain I am typically in and how sickle cell has truly affected all parts of my body. I am always in the hospital because any little thing triggers a crisis such as being cold for too long or even chewing on too much ice. I am constantly fighting for my life physically, but I know God fights for me spiritually. Through it all, God has provided me with community and reassurance. This disease will not be the death of me and it is not bigger than the program. I am covered by the blood of Jesus, whom strengthens me. With all that being said, I wanted to provide you guys with information on how to give back to those with sickle cell. Unfortunately, there is no cure, but there are different ways you guys can help. 2 Corinthians 9:7 says "Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.‚Äù I am not forcing you guys, do as the spirit leads. On the home page, I have provided a way for you guys to donate blood with any Red Cross close to you. There is also a website to provide you guys with more information on what sickle cell is, how it affects people, clinical trials, and ongoing research you guys could donate to. Sickle cell is a deadly disease, but God controls the timer on my life. I am grateful for those who donates, researches, or even just prays for those battling the disease. No action is too small so let's share the gospel by shining a light on those in need. (September 4 2025)<p>
