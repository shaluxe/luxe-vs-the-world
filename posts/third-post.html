    <h2>Side of the Road, Center of His Will</h2>

      <p>And then it hit me...."Was I meant to be here?" Not just “here” as in stranded on the side of the road with a flat tire and the smell of burnt rubber in the air, but here in this exact moment. The sun was beating down, I was on the way to the library, and all I could think was how inconvenient this was. But somewhere between the frustration and the silence of the empty road, I realized God had something to say. I had a glorious morning. I was blessed with an internship and as I am leaving for the library, a couple stops me about my tire being flat. I am immedistely frustrated. They help me fill up my tire and tell me a tire place to go to that could help me and the people are very nice. I BARELY made it to the shop. As I am waiting for my tire to be fixed i tell myself "Maybe there is a reason God made my tire pop. Maybe it's stopping me from being in an accident" As i have those thoughts, the owner of the shop starts speaking to me. I tell her I am going to the library and I was on my way to study. She asks what I am studying for and I tell her my future endeavors. For context, for the longest, I have dealt with losing faith heavily that I will not become who I want to be career wise and as I am typing this I am realizing it was never a thought of "God can't do this" but more so "I can't do it" and it was never by my might. Nothing I do will ever cancel out God's will for my life (maybe delay, so make sure every decision you are making is with God). Recently, I had a burst of faith not only in myself, but in God. It's like God turned off all the anxiety in my body. I started seeing visions of me in living my dreams. The owner of the tire shop starts telling me she believes in me and she sees me living my dreams. The conversation turned into her husband also joining in and they are both telling me how I should not let anyone project their fears onto me because my dreams are big and there is a reason God has placed me to want to pursue this dream regardless of its difficulty. God has gotten me this far and there is no chance of him forsaking me. Hearing them speak life into me and they know nothing about me made me believe I am not overconfident. I am faithful. I am blessed. As they are speaking to me I just start crying because they don't even know how bad I needed this. I've been asking God to show me a clear sign and make it clear "not a metaphor", a clear sign that everything I am doing is right and I am exactly where he has placed me. The owner told me that people sometimes come to the shop to pray or just talk and it is amazing how the power of God visited me today. She gave me a hug and proceeded to tell me "I don't even know you, but I am getting goosebumps just thinking about your future. Come and see me next year when you achieve everything" I am so undeserving of God and the love he consistently shows me. I am so loved by my heavenly father and there are no words for what happened to me today and he KNEW I needed to hear that. It felt like God was speaking to me through them. It is amazing how I went from the side of the road to the center of his will. (August 15 2025)</p>
