  <h1>Post Grad Life</h1>
  <p><em>August 6, 2025</em></p>

  <p>If you have a job in this economy, consider yourself blessed. It is so humbling going from being a Biomedical Engineer and feeling like you are on top of the world to now devoting your life to studying because you want to pursue other things. I know what you are thinking. I COULD study while working, but I absolutely need to be full time studying. I know I am exactly where God has placed me to be, but being jobless is making me go crazy. How do you fully rely on God? What does that look like to you? Right now for me I am struggling with fully surrendering my joblessness and studying to God. I am also getting baptised this month. WOOOHOOOOOOO. Finally, right? Why am i consistently getting this feeling of "I need to have my life together and perfect by the time I get baptised", but that is not the truth at all. I have decided to give my life to Christ and I understand what that means and looks like. Overall, I need a good stern talking to from God. I just need him and him alone. I need to understand that I have given it to him and it is not mine to try and control at this point because if God does not want me to have a job. I will not have a job no matter how many applications I send out. Comment and let me know what your thoughts are. Are you Jobless? Is there something you want from God and you feel like it is being 'delayed'? (God is always on time)</p>
