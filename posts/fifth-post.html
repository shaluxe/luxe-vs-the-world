    <h2>Dead To Sin, Alive in Christ</h2>

      <p>I GOT BAPTISED TODAYYYYYYY!!!!! What Jesus did in my heart, I declared in the water. I am sooooooo full of joy I don't even know how to express it through the screen you just need to catch me in person. Going from depression and multiple suicide attempts to fully commiting my life to God and walking in my purpose. This day has been LONG awaited. To my community, you guys have watched my trials and tribulations and have continued to stand with me and pray over me. This is a glorious day not only for me, but for yall. The heavens are rejoicing at the community I have now compared to my past relationships with people. I am renewed. It's so interesting because the way my week went just feels like every thing that happened was just so intentional. God is so detailed and intentional with everything he does in my life and wow. When I emerged from the water, it felt like I was entering a new self. I am so excited for the future and what God has in store for me, but let me not act like the devil not finna work 10 times harder, but my God is bigger than anything he tries to bring my way. Galatians 2:20 says 'I have been crucified in Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me' I am forever grateful for God's grace. He literally gave his one and only son to die for our sins. That is literally a love like no other. Today I chose Jesus publicly and from now on, I'll follow and surrender myself to him fully. This is not the end of my story, but the beginning of a new life in Christ.<p>
