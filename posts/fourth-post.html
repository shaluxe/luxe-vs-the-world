    <h2>Alive in Flesh,Absent in Friendship</h2>
    <p><em>Posted August 2025</em></p>

    <article>
      <p>I never knew tears could fall so hard over someone who still has a heartbeat. But I am learning that God uses the kind of grief that comes from lost friendships,broken trust, and unanswered questions to draw me back to him. It can be hard trying to process your emotions especially when it is someone you genuinely care about. Psalm 34:18 says 'The lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit' (NIV) but why does he feel so far. I never want to lie to you guys and say I always feel God's presence in every distraught moment. In this moment I feel confused, hurt, and all I want is my friend back. This does not mean I do not have faith in God. I am someone that typically holds a lot of things in and this person specifically has put me through a lot of emotional abuse to the point of no return. I know God is rejoicing that I have finally left the friendship. If I sit here and tell you guys everything it would be more than just one post and I am not here to gossip about them, but to tell you guys how God has continued to be merciful in this time of pain. You're probably thinking I am full of pride and it is as easy as reaching out, but sometimes things really need to end. Ecclesiates 3:1,5 says 'There is a time for everything...a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing' (NIV) Unfortunately, I embraced longer than God ever intended and here I am dealing with heartbreak I was never supposed to go through, but I will not dwell on the past because my father is doing a new thing (Isaiah 43:18-19 NIV) This does not mean I do not have love for my friend because that will never change and as brokenhearted as I am, I am sure that the pain is temporary and God will get all the glory in the end because the glory is always his not mine.
