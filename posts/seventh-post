    <h2>Girl, Do Better</h2>

      <p>I think for the first time in a while I actually do not know how to put what I am feeling into words. This post might be very similar to my first one, but on a differnt scale. I have been having excess anxiety as of recently due to being in the unknown. I was speaking to a pastor at the hospital I intern at and he had me read Psalm 103. The anxiety I feel is not about me not trusting God, but more so shame and guilt and being scared that God is mad at me. I want you guys to go look at Psalm 103 verses 8,9, and 14. (I want to stop putting the bible verses in the posts because I need you guys to actively open your bible) After reading that, with a father like that, how could be be mad at me? He knows what I lack and what I attain. He knows what I did and he has forgiven me, but this does not mean continue because you know he is going to forgive you. Look at John 8:11. Jesus tells the woman to go and SIN NO MORE. He forgave her, but he's telling her "girl go do better because if you keep sinning, worse will happen (John 5:4)" It's amazing to know that we serve such a gracious and merciful God. It's human that I read my bible and still get anxious as long as I am praying, leaving it at the feet of Jesus, and letting the holy spirit unite me with Christ so that I may attain the fruits of the spirit by continuing to be in my word. I also need to speak God's words over my mind, body, and soul because he has the last say. When I tell you guys before today I was in limbo trying to do things on my own, researching every inch of the internet on how to not have anxiety, making myself believe that God is mad at me, carrying so much shame and guilt that kept me from believing his word til I said no more. These are the lies of the devil. The things of this world feel amazing, but they are so detrimental to the kingdom of God. Sex, gossiping, lying, stealing and all sin is not worth going to hell over. Sinning is also worse when you don't repent because that's how you start to believe what you are doing is fine. Trust me, and this is because I have been through it. Read your word and as your heart grows for God, it will shrink for sin. <p>
